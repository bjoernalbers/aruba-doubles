Feature: Doubles History

	I order to check for proper double execution and implement mocking support
	As a BDD-guy
	I want every run of a double to be logged with full arguments to a history.

	# Scenario: Happy path...
	# 	Given the history is empty
	# 	And I could run `foo`
	# 	Then `foo` should not have been run
	# 	When I run `foo`
	# 	Then `foo` should have been run
